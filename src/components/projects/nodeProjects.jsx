The Twitter API provides 20 of the user's most recent tweets. The Spotify API allows the user to search for a song by title or title and band name; it provides multiple responses. OMBD provides selected information about the title of the film searched.Â Twitter and Spotify require any potential users to provide their own .env file with keys to the different APIs. OMBD has an access key built into the code but it would work more reliably if you provided your personal key. Default searches are provided for both OMBD and Spotify.There is no user interface for this application, it is recommend you either fork the code to your own system."
